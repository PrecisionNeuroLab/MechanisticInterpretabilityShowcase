## Overview

This showcase demonstrates tools and techniques for understanding neural network behavior through mechanistic interpretability. Our goal is to make AI systems more transparent and interpretable.

## What is Mechanistic Interpretability?

Mechanistic interpretability is the study of understanding neural networks by identifying and analyzing the specific algorithms and circuits they learn. Rather than treating neural networks as black boxes, this approach aims to reverse-engineer their internal mechanisms.

### Key Concepts

1. **Feature Visualization**: Understanding what individual neurons or layers respond to
2. **Circuit Analysis**: Identifying computational pathways within networks
3. **Activation Patterns**: Analyzing how information flows through the network
4. **Intervention Studies**: Testing hypotheses about network behavior through targeted modifications
